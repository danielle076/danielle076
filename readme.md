## Hey there,

I am Danielle and currently a frontend and backend developer student. I hope to finish the frontend study at the end of May and the backend study at the end of November.

On github I am trying out my programming skills. You can see that I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I also have experience with functional design, Adobe XD and Firebase. Later on this will be joined by Java, database and Spring Boot.

Projects I am currently working on:
