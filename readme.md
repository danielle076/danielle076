## Hey there 👋

I am Daniëlle and currently a junior frontend developer and a backend developer student 🎓. I finished the frontend study at the end of June and the backend study hopefully at the end of November.

On github I am trying out my programming skills. You can see that I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I also have experience with functional design, Adobe XD and Firebase. Later on this will be joined by Java, database and Spring Boot.

### 📄 Projects I am currently working on
- Java, the basics
- Java, advanced
